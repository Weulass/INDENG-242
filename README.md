# INDENG-242
Introduction
This is the repo for INDENG242 - Data Analysis and Applications, Fall 19 at UC Berkeley

This course applies foundational concepts and techniques in machine learning and data analysis to a diverse set of examples using real datasets from domains such as e-commerce, healthcare, social media, sports, the Internet, and more.  Through these examples, exercises in R, and a comprehensive team project,  we will explore and apply techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, classification and regression trees, random forests, boosting, text mining, data cleaning and manipulation, data visualization, network analysis, time series modeling, clustering, principal component analysis, regularization, neural networks, and large-scale learning.
